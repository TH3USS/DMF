Development of a fleet sizing software as a product for Professor Marcos JosÃ© Correa Bueno, logistics professor at Fatec Guarulhos college. The project involved professionals in database, documentation, analysts, development, and software testing.

The software consists of a gamification created by the professor to make the fleet sizing lessons more dynamic, transformed by our team into software, aiming to enable logistics students to practice the knowledge acquired regarding the Fleet Sizing subject.

The software was developed with .NET CORE in Windows Forms using C# programming language and MySQL as the database.
